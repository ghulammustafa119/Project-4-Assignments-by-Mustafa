# Print 10 random numbers in the range 1 to 100.

# Here is an example run:

# 45 79 61 47 52 10 16 83 19 12

# Each time you run your program you should get different numbers

# 81 76 70 1 27 63 96 100 32 92

# Recall that the python random library has a function randint which returns an integer in the range set by the parameters (inclusive). For example this call would produce a random integer between 1 and 6, which could include 1 and could include 6:

# value = random.randint(1, 6)






import random

N_NUMBERS : int = 10
MIN_VALUE : int = 1
MAX_VALUE : int = 100

def main():
    # Generate N_NUMBERS random numbers between MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE
    random_numbers = [random.randint(MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE) for _ in range(N_NUMBERS)]
    
    # Print the generated random numbers
    print("Generated random numbers:", random_numbers)
